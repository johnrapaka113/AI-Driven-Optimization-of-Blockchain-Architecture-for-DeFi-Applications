# AI-Driven-Optimization-of-Blockchain-Architecture-for-DeFi-Applications

This project is a full-featured web application that integrates artificial intelligence, blockchain analytics, financial modeling, and sentiment analysis to support smart cryptocurrency investment decisions. Built with Streamlit, it empowers users to analyze, optimize, and manage DeFi portfolios with powerful AI-driven insights.

Features

    User Authentication – Secure login and registration system using SQLite and bcrypt.
    
    Cryptocurrency Price Prediction – Ensemble models (LightGBM, CatBoost, TabNet, Prophet) with SHAP-based explainability.
    
    Risk Analysis – Includes Value at Risk (VaR), Sharpe Ratio, and investment recommendations.
    
    Portfolio Management – Create, edit, visualize, and optimize your crypto portfolio.
    
    Dynamic Rebalancing – Reinforcement learning (DQN) for adaptive portfolio strategies.
    
    Anomaly Detection – Detect unusual asset behavior using Isolation Forest.
    
    Transaction Network Analysis – Visualize blockchain transaction networks using Graph Neural Networks.
    
    Blockchain Monitoring – Fetch on-chain stats via Blockchair API.
    
    DeFi Insights – Access DeFi protocol TVL data through DeFiLlama API.
    
    Social Sentiment Analysis – Uses VADER, FinBERT, and DistilBERT for real-time sentiment tracking.
    
    Trading Alerts – Alerts based on price volatility, sentiment, and behavioral anomalies.
    
    Simulated Decentralized Deployment – Demonstrates Chainlink-style oracle integration.
    
    Market Scenario Simulation – Generates possible market outcomes using Variational Autoencoders.

How It Works
    Price Prediction: Fetches historical crypto data and trains multiple ML models to forecast future prices.
    
    Portfolio Management: Stores user holdings, calculates value, visualizes allocation, and suggests optimized weights.
    
    AI Modules: Uses ensemble learning, explainable AI (SHAP), reinforcement learning, VAE simulation, and GNN transaction modeling.
    
    Sentiment Analysis: Scrapes crypto news and applies multiple transformer/NLP-based sentiment models.
    
    API Integrations: Interfaces with real-time blockchain and DeFi data sources to enhance prediction accuracy.

Example Use Cases
    A crypto trader wants to forecast ETH price trends for the upcoming week.
    
    A DeFi investor wants to minimize risk and maximize returns using AI-driven rebalancing strategies.
    
    A data scientist explores sentiment influence on token prices using NLP models.
    
    A researcher simulates future market scenarios and stress tests a virtual portfolio.
